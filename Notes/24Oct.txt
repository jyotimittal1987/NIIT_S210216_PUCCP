We want to develop the software

S/w: Set of instructions which is used to perform a specific task.

Calculator : TO perform some calculations

Paytm : transfer money,pay bills
WhatsApp: Messages
Zomato : Online Food order
Ola : book cab

Customer demands s/w , to make his life easy, 

s/w:
Operating System-windows, MAC, Android, ios,Linux
Browser, VLC, MS office
Mobile bases Apps
Web Apps

==============================
How to develop s/w:
To develop the s/w, we want to give the instruction to machine,

How to give instruction to machine:we need a programming language 

Programming Languages :

C, c++, Java, Python, COBOL,c#,VB,J#


C Programming Language : It is used to develop the software. 

- We will give the instruction to machine using C Programming language..
-We will learn c Vocublary, rules and regulations of the C Programming Language:

=============================================
Generation of Progarmming Language :

1)First Generation Language (Machine Language): 
---Machine Language : That is understood by the machine and it is in the binary form ( 0's and 1's)

ADD: 1010101
     0101010
All commands used to give 1 and 0 only.

Advantage:
1)You dont need to translate and directly it will execute by computer.
2) Programs were very speedy and efficient

Disadvantage : 
1)Writing code in 0 and 1 is very complex


2) Second Generation Language(Assembly Language) : We were using Mneumonics:

A  :ADD
Mp: Multiply
CMP : Compare

Advantange : 
1)Less prone to errors 
2)Easy to write than 1 GL
3)Easy to remove Errors

3)Third Generation Language(High level Language) : 
--All the instructions are given in the english written form 
--Programmer has to focus only on the logic to perform the task
--- C, C++, Java
--to develop the code using 3GL is very easy 
--Less prone to Errors and easy to maintain

Program : set of instruction 

4)Fourth Generation Language(Very High level Language):
--Implementing Database
--Productivity increases as programmer has to write fewer lines of code
--Easy to code, maintain, cost effective
--PHP, SQL, Ruby,Python

5) Fifth Generation Language : ARtificial Intelligence (AI)

=========================================================================================
1) Interpreter
2) Compilor 

High level Language : We are giving the instruction using English written form but machine understands machine language(1 and 0),


Interpreter :
--Translate program one statement at a time.
--Execution time is slower than Compilor
--Memory Efficient - No intermediate object is created 
--Javascript, Python

Compilor : 
--Translate /Scan the entire program and convert it into machine code
--Fast 
--C, C++, Java
--It requires more memory as Intermediate object may et created
========================================================================

C Programming Language :

--Denis Ritchie Developed the C Progarmming Language in 1972,
--It is a High level Programming Language
--It was compilor based
-- To write  the UNIX Operating system, C was invented.
--C is a case sensitive langauge
======================First C Program===========================
//WAP to display Hello World
#include<stdio.h>
main()//main is the entry point of application
{
//printf() is used to display the message on the screen
printf("Hello World");
}




Compile/Build: Compilor will convert source code into machine code ,also check for any syntax Error,but it will not show thw output(o/p). 
Execute/Run :It will show you the output.


C Program:

1) PreProcessor Directive: # is known as PreProcessor directives
	include is a keyword
2)stdio: standard input and output : 
	printf() : To display any msg on the screen
	.h : header files
3)main() : Predefined function in C Programming which is actually entry point of an application.

main()
{
//code

}
