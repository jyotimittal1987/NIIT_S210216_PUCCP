Encapsulaton and abstraction:

Encapsulation :
- Feature of oops
-We are hiding the non essentials details from user 
-Information hiding : Hiding irrelavant information from user
- To be enclosed in a capsule


------------------------------------------------------
Abstraction :

=======================================================

Encapsulation and Abstraction can be achieved by Access Specifiers:

1)private : It is by default . You wont be able to access private member outside the class
2)public : You will be able to acess all members outside the class
3)protected : Only sub class in case of Inheritance will be able to access it.
