Inheritance : 
- The process of deriving the properites of a one class into another .
- Reusability- Once the properties have been defined in parent class, we can use them as it is in child class.

class Vehicle  //parent class..base class ...super class
{
float price;
int no_of_wheels;
char color[10];
char brand[20];
}
class Motor_bike : public Vehicle  //child class..derived class..sub class
{ 
int engine;

}
class Cars : public Vehicle
{
char gearType[20];
}

Types : 
1) Single level Inheritance
2)Multilevel Inheritance
3)Multiple Inheritance
4)Hierarchical Inheritance
5)Hybrid Inheritance- Diamond problem
